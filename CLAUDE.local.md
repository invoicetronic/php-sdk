# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an auto-generated PHP SDK for the Italian eInvoice API by Invoicetronic. The SDK provides a client library for interacting with the Italian Servizio di Interscambio (SDI) for electronic invoice processing.

## Common Commands

### Dependencies
- `composer install` - Install dependencies

### Testing
- `vendor/bin/phpunit` - Run all tests (uses phpunit.xml.dist configuration)
- Tests are located in `test/Api/` and `test/Model/` directories

### Code Quality
- `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix` - Format code using PHP-CS-Fixer (if available)

## Architecture

### Core Components

**API Layer** (`lib/Api/`):
- CompanyApi - Company management operations
- LogApi - Event logging and retrieval
- ReceiveApi - Incoming invoice handling
- SendApi - Outgoing invoice operations (files, JSON, XML)
- UpdateApi - Invoice update operations
- WebhookApi - Webhook management and history

**Model Layer** (`lib/Model/`):
- Italian eInvoice data structures following FatturaPA XML schema
- All models implement ModelInterface for consistent serialization
- Key models: FatturaOrdinaria, Company, Send, Receive, WebHook

**Core Infrastructure**:
- `Configuration.php` - API configuration and authentication (HTTP Basic Auth)
- `ObjectSerializer.php` - JSON/object serialization handling
- `HeaderSelector.php` - HTTP header management
- `ApiException.php` - Exception handling

### Authentication
- Uses HTTP Basic Authentication (username/password)
- Default host: `http://localhost` (configure via Configuration class)

### Generated Code
All PHP classes are auto-generated by OpenAPI Generator v7.10.0. Do not edit the generated files directly as they will be overwritten during regeneration.

## Development Notes

- PHP 7.4+ required
- Uses Guzzle HTTP client for API requests
- Follows PSR-4 autoloading with `Invoicetronic\` namespace
- Test coverage includes both API and Model classes
- Extensive documentation available in `docs/` directory
